# Huzuni
## About
Huzuni was originally developed by Hal (halalaboos). Hal decided stop working on Huzuni on Minecraft version 1.10. 

The version that's currently available isn't very stable either, some of the features don't even work. So I've taken up the burden onto my shoulders to help contribute to this project and update it. At some point I would like to do a fully "Huzuni Remastered" to bring back some of the old UI that, in my opinion, was better, with the side bar option as a keybind.

## Downloads
Downloads will be available [here](https://github.com/MatthewSH/minecraft-Huzuni/releases).

## Versions
### Please note that when I update major versions that I will only be working on that version, I will only update earlier versions for hotfixes, or issues. No new features will be implemented.

| Huzuni Version | Minecraft Version |

| 1.0.0          | 1.11.2            |

## Donate
Donations would be very much appriciated to help keep things going to pay back my time. If you want to include your Minecraft IGN in the comments, if I ever decide to do a custom cape (via [Capes API](http://capesapic.com)) then I'll give you a cape.
